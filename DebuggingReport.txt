Debugging Report - Question 4 Bubble Sort Analysis

Bug #1:  
Breakpoint Setup:
- Set breakpoint at line: for(i = 0; i <= size - 1; i++)
- Watched variables: i, size, array[i], array[i+1]

Analysis:
When stepping through the code, observed critical failure point:
- At i = size-1, array[i+1] attempts to access array[size]
- Watch window showed array access beyond allocated memory
- Variable i reached invalid array position: array[3] for size=3

Bug Fix Implementation:
Changed loop condition from: for(i = 0; i <= size - 1; i++)
To: for(i = 0; i < size - 1; i++)

Verification:
- Stepped through modified code
- Watch window confirmed i stays within valid range
- No more boundary violations observed

Bug #2:  
Breakpoint Setup:
- Set breakpoint at swap operation
- Watched variables: array[i], array[i+1], temp

Debugger Output:
Original problematic sequence:
1. temp.intData = array[i].intData
2. array[i].intData = temp.intData    // Lost original value
3. array[i+1].intData = array[i].intData  // Copying same value

Step-by-step debugging:
- Both elements getting identical values
- Original array[i+1] value completely lost
- Watch window showed duplicate data after swap

Corrected Implementation:
temp = array[i];
array[i] = array[i+1];
array[i+1] = temp;

Post-Fix Verification:
- Debugger stepping showed proper value exchange
- Watch window confirmed distinct values maintained
- All test cases passed after correction
